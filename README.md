# matlab-nn-prediction

Time series prediction with a GUI using Matlab neural network toolbox. 

- Supports four different neural network architectures: static linear, static feed forward, dynamic feed forward with tapped delay line (TDL) and dynamic recurrent (Elman)
- Uses different feature selection mechanisms such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)

main.m: Given time series data, predicts the next value based on the historical data
